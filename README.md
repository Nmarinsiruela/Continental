This was a test project to understand and practise Android programming. Its structure was heavily based on [The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)

Its main utility was to count and display the points made during the rounds of the game. It also included Fabric support, as well as Google Analytics.

As of now (11/2018) this project is obsolete and it would require a complete do-over.
